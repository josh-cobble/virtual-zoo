# virtual-zoo

Welcome to the virtual zoo!

This 'zoo' teaches people about 5 animal species: wolf, gorilla, eagle, elephant, and deer.

When you first start the program, you will be prompted to enter one of the animal species from above.
For example, to learn about wolves, type in 'wolf' (without the quotation marks).
The program will then tell you some facts about wolves.

To learn more about all of the animals, enter 'help' (without the quotation marks). This is not a standard help button.
It instead helps the user learn more, hence the name help.

To exit the program, enter 'exit' (without the quotation marks).

Note that while it is unimportant to the user, this program relies on different packages and makes use of
class inheritance and polymorphism.
